meteor-prism-js
=================

Meteor packaging of the syntax highlighting library Prism.js (by Lea Verou).

This package supports syntax highlighting for:

- Markdown
- CSS
- JavaScript

If anyone needs any other language support, please ask so in the github repo.
I decided to keeo the package small as well as chose the Okaida theme among the
available in the Prism.js [download page](http://prismjs.com/download.html).

Check out the official website for Prism.js [here](http://prismjs.com/).

Thanks to Lea Verou for this awesome library.

### Installation
